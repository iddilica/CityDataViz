# CityDataViz
Repository for experiments and exercises for my MSc Information Science module on Data Visualisation at City University (Spring 2015)

This repository contains very simple code to support my journey learning how to write basic data visualisations with [Processing](https://processing.org).

## Week 2

This week'es exercise involved getting more substantial data into Processing.  We used images that either moved around or as a background for other data.  We also used Table to load in more substantive datasets and plotted [Gapminder data](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) onto a map background image.
